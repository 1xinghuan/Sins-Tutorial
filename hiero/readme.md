# Sins Hiero Tutorial

## Import Shots

Sins support create new shots or update shots information from hiero.

### Create New Shots

Let's say we have some image sequences which are exported from storyboard software and we need to create shots from these sequences.
The shot name should be based on sequence name and frame range should be same as image sequence. 
Also under the shots there should be some tasks, like ani and lgt.

* Firstly you need to make sure the project and sequence are created

### Update Shots

If the storyboard changes, like frame range changes and you just need to update the frame range of shots.
You can choose 'Update' in the import window.
